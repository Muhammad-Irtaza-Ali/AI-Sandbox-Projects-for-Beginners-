## 👨‍💻**NLP Topic Extraction using Bag of Words**
This project demonstrates **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques** to extract important topic words from a given dialogue. It utilizes **tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and Bag of Words (BoW)** to identify the most frequently occurring words after filtering out irrelevant ones.

---

### 📌 **Project Features**
- **Tokenization**: Splits text into individual words.  
- **Lowercasing**: Converts all words to lowercase for consistency.  
- **Stopword Removal**: Eliminates common words like "the," "and," etc.  
- **Lemmatization**: Converts words to their root forms (e.g., "battles" → "battle").  
- **Custom Stopwords**: Allows removal of domain-specific words.  
- **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Counts word frequencies to identify key topics.  

---

### 🚀 **Technologies Used**
- **Python**  
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**  
- **Counter (from collections module)**  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for optional visualization)

### 📂 **How to Use**
#### 1️⃣ **Install Required Libraries**
Ensure you have the required libraries installed. If not, run:
```bash
pip install nltk
pip install matplotlib seaborn
```

#### 2️⃣ **Download NLTK Data**
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

#### 3️⃣ **Run the Script**
Execute the script to extract the most important words from the given text.

### 📊 **Sample Output**
```
🔹 Top 10 Most Common Words After Preprocessing:
empire: 3
resistance: 2
hope: 2
battle: 2
overthrow: 1
leader: 1
public: 1
war: 1
win: 1
strategy: 1
```
In this example, **"empire"** appears most frequently, making it the dominant **topic word**.

---

### 🛠 **Future Enhancements**
- Implement **TF-IDF** for better keyword extraction.
- Apply **LDA topic modeling** for advanced topic identification.
- Build a simple **web app** using **Flask or Streamlit** to input text dynamically.
