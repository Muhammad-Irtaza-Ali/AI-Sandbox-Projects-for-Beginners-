# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using Linear Regression  

This project demonstrates **Linear Regression** for predicting the **quality of red and white wine** based on its **fixed acidity**.  

## 📌 Overview  
✔️ The dataset used is **winequality-red.csv**, containing **chemical properties** of red wine.  
✔️ We **visualize** the relationship between **Fixed Acidity** and **Wine Quality**.  
✔️ A **Linear Regression Model** is trained to predict wine quality.  

## 📊 Dataset Information  
- **Fixed Acidity**  
- **Volatile Acidity**  
- **Citric Acid**  
- **Residual Sugar**  
- **Chlorides**  
- **Free Sulfur Dioxide**  
- **Total Sulfur Dioxide**  
- **Density**  
- **pH**  
- **Sulphates**  
- **Alcohol**  
- **Quality (Target Variable)**  

## 🚀 Steps in the Project  
1️⃣ **Load the dataset** using Pandas.  
2️⃣ **Extract the feature** (`Fixed Acidity`) and target (`Quality`).  
3️⃣ **Visualize** the relationship using a **scatter plot**.  
4️⃣ **Train a Linear Regression Model** to predict wine quality.  
5️⃣ **Plot the regression line** to see how well it fits the data.  
6️⃣ **Evaluate model performance** using **R-squared score**.  

## 🔧 How to Run  
1️⃣ Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```  
2️⃣ Place `winequality-red.csv` in the project folder.  
3️⃣ Run the script to train the model and visualize predictions.  

## 📈 Expected Output  
- **Scatter plot** of Fixed Acidity vs. Quality  
- **Regression line** showing the trend  
- **R-squared score** for model evaluation  

## 🎯 Key Learnings  
✔️ **Linear Regression helps analyze numerical relationships.**  
✔️ **Wine quality is influenced by multiple factors, not just acidity.**  
✔️ **R-squared score indicates model accuracy.**
