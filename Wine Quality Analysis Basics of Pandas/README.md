# 🍷 Wine Quality Analysis  

This project analyzes **white and red wine datasets** using **pandas**, focusing on **grouping, sorting, and concatenation** to derive meaningful insights about wine quality.  

## 📌 Overview  
- **Dataset**: `winequality-white.csv` & `winequality-red.csv`  
- **Operations Performed**:  
  ✔️ Grouping wines by quality & pH level  
  ✔️ Sorting by quality and alcohol content  
  ✔️ Concatenating red & white wine datasets  

## 📊 Sections  

### 1️⃣ **Grouping Wines**  
✔ **By Quality**: Computes the **mean alcohol content** for each quality rating.  
✔ **By pH Level**: Determines the **average quality rating** based on pH categories.  

### 2️⃣ **Sorting Data**  
✔ **Descending order by quality** (Best wines first).  
✔ **Ascending order by alcohol content** (Least to most alcoholic).  

### 3️⃣ **Concatenation**  
✔ **Combines red & white wine datasets** into a single dataset `combine_wine.csv`.  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1️⃣ Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```  
2️⃣ Run the Python script.  
3️⃣ Check the **sorted & grouped results** in the console.  
4️⃣ Find the final combined dataset as `combine_wine.csv`.  

## 📊 Key Insights  
✔ **Higher quality wines tend to have a balanced alcohol percentage.**  
✔ **pH levels influence the perceived wine quality.**  
✔ **Sorting helps in quickly identifying the best wines.**
